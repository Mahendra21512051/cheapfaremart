        answer: `In addition to extra seating (up to 9 passengers vs up to 5 in an standard SUV) and cargo

        question: "What is  Four-Wheel Drive or 4WD",
        answer: `Four-wheel drive (4WD) is a drivetrain system that sends power to all four wheels of a vehicle simultaneously,
     improving traction on rough, slippery, or off-road surfaces. Most of the SUVs feature a 
    4WD system that makes them drive easily on challenging terrains. Again, in some vehicles, 4WD comes with 2 modes- Four
     High (4H) and Four Low (4L). 4H helps with driving on snow, gravel, or light off-road terrain at a normal pace while 4L helps with 
     attaining maximum traction for extreme off-road situations like deep mud, sand, or steep inclines.`
